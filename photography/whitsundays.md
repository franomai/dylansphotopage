These photos were taken on a trip to the Whitsunday Islands and Lamington National Park with members of the [UTS Outdoor Adventure Club][advclub] in 1999. There are more photos still to come (pending a transparency scanner), and some day I may also get around to providing proper captions for the individual pages. If anyone who was on the trip would like to provide their own pictures to include on this site, let me know

All images on this and linked pages Â© Dylan Sutton 1999. All photographs were taken with an Olympus OM1, which was sadly suffering from a poorly adjusted shutter curtain (which can be seen in the picture PNM, for example).
