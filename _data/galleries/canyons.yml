  title: Mark
  caption: Mark Agnew helps a less experienced canyoner down a short drop in a side creek leading into "Why don't we do it in the road" (or "serendipity") canyon on an OAC trip in early 1998. Why do the OAC use this longer, scrubbier, wetter and muddier entrance to the canyon when there is a better one  at least as scenic? - Olympus OM 1, Zuiko 35-70 f4, Velvia - © Dylan Sutton, 1998

  caption: This shot was taken at lunchtime on one of the larger trips down the Wollangambe that I can recall, a SUBW trip in early 1992. With fantastic weather, relatively warm water and even a platypus sighting, I can't remember a more relaxed canyon trip than this one. - Olympus OM 10, Magnon 35-200, Kodachrome 64. - © Dylan Sutton, 1992.
