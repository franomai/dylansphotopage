  title: Whitewater wall 2
  caption: Katrina belays from the halfway ledge I have just left. Why did I ignore the guidebook and leave that secure, easy gully for those loose blocks and ants nests at a somewhat stffer grade? Was it the plants in the gully, or simply the lure of a more direct finish? With no pro and ants crawling up my leg I realised once more that I'm a chicken, and scurried back onto the described route, but not before having to reverse the nasty mantel and blank traverse that put me there... - Olympus OM1, Tamron 24 f2.5, Velvia - © Dylan Sutton, 1999
