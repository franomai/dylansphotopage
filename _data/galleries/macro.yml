  caption: I just happened to spot this amazingly patterned beetle one afternoon in our back garden. It is sitting on the charred but recovering trunk of a gum tree, burnt in the bushfires of the previous year (1994). - Olympus OM1, Magnon 35-200, Kodachrome - © Dylan Sutton, 1995

  title: Extreme
  caption: One of the few "staged" shots in my collection. This is an extreme close up of a little flower picked from the back garden. Taken in the days before I owned genuine extension tubes, for this picture I handheld the camera with the Zuiko 50 f1.8 ("Made in Japan" version, for those who must know!) at the end of a black cardboard tube, giving approximately 15cm extension. The lens was stopped down to f11 by taping the DOF preview button. The flower was sitting on a piece of dark grey cloth, and lit by direct flash from behind, using a Vivitar 1800 on a cord from the camera PC socket. I'd like to say that I calculated the exposure using the appropriate formulae for extension, but really it was guesswork and bracketing. - Olympus OM1, Zuiko 50 f1.8, cardboard tube, Vivitar 1800, Velvia - © Dylan Sutton, 1999

  caption: These tiny red fungi were growing above the track in Monolith Vally, the Budawangs, and their colour was even brighter in real life. - Olympus OM 1, Sigma 70-210 f3.5-4.5, Velvia - © Dylan Sutton, 1999

  title: Mt Wilson Ferns
  caption: Lush dark green ferns grow in the volcanic soils of Mt Wilson in the Blue Mountains. The presence of blackberry vines (an introduced weed) dictated the artistic angle of the shot. - Olympus OM 1, Tamron 24 f2.5, Velvia - © Dylan Sutton, 2021

  title: Passionfruit flower
  caption: The flower of a passionfruit vine growing outside my bedroom window. The flowers are about 8 cm wide, and the stamens stick out approximately 5 cm above the plane of the petals, so getting sufficient DOF is a problem. - Olympus OM 1, Zuiko 50 f1.8 @f11, Olympus extension tubes, Olympus T20 flash on 1/2 power auto, Velvia - © Dylan Sutton, 1999

  title: Pineapple
  caption: It's not really a pineapple, but some member of the Scoparia family (I think). This specimen is growing on the shore of Lake Cygnus (SW Tasmania), and is wet from the sleet and rainstorm that whipped into our faces all morning as we trudged up Moraine A. - Olympus OM1, Sigma 75-210 f3.5-4.5, Velvia - © Dylan Sutton, 1997

  caption: I came upon this tree in flower near where Mt Hay canyon breaks through the cliffline into the Grose Valley. The soft lighting and dark background made for a nice picture. - Olympus OM1, Sigma 70-210 f3.5-4.5, 2xTC, Velvia - © Dylan Sutton, 1997
