  title: Frenchmans Cap
  caption: Katrina borrows my tripod for a panorama shot looking northwest from the summit of Frenchmans cap, after the tremendous effort of getting up there only 2 weeks after herniating a disc in her nursing job. Medical advice was "stay as activa as possible", which in her case included this trip of over 20 rugged km in under 12 hours, with more than 1000m of climbing (and 1000 descending on the way back!), and including several hours on the summit and a swim in Lake Tahune. Mind you, I carried the pack... - Olympus OM1, Sigma 70-210 f3.5-4.5, Velvia - © Dylan Sutton, 1997

  title: Hazards Beach
  caption: After a day swimming in the hot sun, a chill sets in when the sun begins to set. With the long summer twilight in Tasmania, plenty of time remains to explore the rocky shores at the western end of Hazards beach before cooking and sleep. A perfect destination for relaxed camping. - Olympus OM1, Tamron 24 f2.5, Velvia - © Dylan Sutton, 1999
