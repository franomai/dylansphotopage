A selection of pictures from a trip to Vietnam in December 1999 to January 2000. Katrina went to Vietnam on a scholarship from Royal North Shore Hospital with other students from the University of Sydney Graduate Medical Program. The group spent the month of December working in various hospitals in Hanoi, in conjunction with the medical faculty of the University of Hanoi.
On Christmas eve I joined them and spent a week seeing the sights of Hanoi, before their work was done and they were free to travel. Katrina and I spent the next two weeks doing a short tour of some of the sights of the North, while the others raced down to Ho Chi Minh City (Saigon).
