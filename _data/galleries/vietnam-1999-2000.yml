  title: Cat Ba Harbour
  caption: Sunset over Cat Ba harbour in Halong Bay. The high pollution in Vietnam makes for some colourful sunsets, but the sun often disappear in the smog before it dips below the horizon. Many of the myriad houseboats anchored in the harbour serve as restaurants by night. Seafood doesn't come much fresher than this... The first time I tried to frame this shot from near the end of the pier I was mobbed by curious children and restaurant touts. I grabbed my tripod and ran, but thankfully not quick enough - an american guy we had met earlier that day decided to  set up his tripod in the spot I had just vacated, and served as a very handy decoy! While he struggled with the masses between his lens and the view, and the sun rapidly set behind the low clouds of pollution on the horizon, I was able to take this picture. - Olympus OM 1, Sigma 70-210 f3.5-4.5 @ 210mm f4.5, 1/125s, Fuji Superia - © Dylan Sutton, Dec 1999

  caption: Taken near the previous photo just outside Bac Ha, these children interrupted their play to watch the funny-looking tourists. Not having been exposed to westerners for very long, these people have yet to learn how effective begging is, and instead are friendly and genuine. My tripod was obviously totally new to them, and everyone wanted to touch and feel. - Olympus OM1, Tamron 24 f2.5, E100 VS - © Dylan Sutton, 2000

  title: Bac Ha Yarns
  caption: The various tribes of the H'Mong people can be identified by traditional patterns and colours of clothing. The Flower H'Mong women have embraced modern synthetic dyes and fabrics with a vengeance, and their clothes when new are a dazzling swirl of bright colours. Fake velvet in blues and greens, tufted and with polkadots seems to be all the rage. In this picture, women are choosing from the many brightly coloured yarns at a stall in the Saturday markets in Bac Ha. The woman in the foreground is holding sugar cane, a ubiquitous source of food in the mountains. At Sapa the weekend markets have degenerated to the point where most people are selling tourist trinkets. Locals at Bac Ha haven't yet caught on to the fact that selling food, firewood and tobacco to each other is less lucrative than selling clothing and jewellery to tourists, so you are free to walk around without the constant harassment of "you like, you like!". How long will it stay that way? Tourist dollars may be an easier living than suistence farming, but what is the effect on their culture and traditions of turning a generation of children into beggars? On the bright side, some of them demonstrate great resourcefulness and entrepreneurialism, selling Coke and Sprite on walking trails miles from the nearest fridge, or acting as guides and interpreters - it was quite a surprise to hear a young (about 13?) girl in Sapa speak near fluent english. As a tourist, who am I to criticise the changes brought upon them by tourism, and begrudge them the increased living standards they can buy with the dollars they earn from us? Reverse cultural imperialism? If you have any interesting links on Vietnamese culture or the ethics of tourism, email me. - Olympus OM1, Zuiko 35-70 f4 @35mm f4, Konica Impresa 50 © Katrina Webster, Jan 2000

  caption: The 'trusty' bicycle I rented in Ninh Binh lies in front of the brickworks beside the Hoang Long river. Though we only rode 50  km, I have never been so sore after a day on a bike. Perhaps this had to do with the saddle which was 20 cm too low, 20 cm too far forwards, twisted to the left and losing its cover, or maybe it was the bent pedals and short cranks, oor the flat tire, or maybe it was all of these things and the ferocious headwind we got riding in both directions along the rough dirt roads. - Olympus OM1, Tamron 24 f2.5, Velvia - © Dylan Sutton, 2000

The clay for the brigs was dug by hand from the river banks, poured into a forming machine, and then the bricks were stacked to dry  in the sun before firing in charcoal fired kilns. - Olympus OM1, Sigma 70-210 f3.5-4.5, Velvia - © Dylan Sutton, 2000

  thumbnail: Buffalo-full.jpg
  title: Buffalo
  caption: On the return leg of our walk through the hills around Bac Ha, our guide became slightly lost. Perhaps this had to do with the excellent corn wine which we sampled in one of the small villages, as he looked very flushed and stumbled a few times despite only drinking a small cup. The 'scenic route' home was indeed very pretty, and led us past these buffalo who backed away in fright, obviously never having encountered a bunch of tourists before. We also walked through some of the orchards for which this area is famed, but as it was nearly dark by then I didn't take any pictures. - Olympus OM1, Tamron 24  f2.5, E100 VS - © Dylan Sutton, 2000

  caption: Dau Go island contains some pretty limestone caves which despite being part of the World Heritage listed Halong Bay are sadly abused. Though the signs banning smoking and littering are abundant and rubbish bins are plenty, the "official photographers" in the caves light up as soon as the tourists have passed, and discard their cigarette butts and soft drink cans down the nearest available crevice. The island lies just outside Halong city and is frequented by many of the boas on the way to Cat Ba Island. - Olympus OM1, Tamron 24 f2.5, E100 VS - © Dylan Sutton, 2000

  caption: A group of tourism students from Hanoi University practice their trade (and their English) with our group of Aussies, seen here in front of the mausoleum of "Uncle Ho", President Ho Chi Minh. Ho Chi Minh is remarkably well preserved (he is rejuvenated yearly in Beijing) and under the sodium lights of the mausoleum looks as if he is merely sleeping.  The people seem genuinely respectful, even fond of their old leader - he seems to represent the hopes offered by the communist ideal, without bearing the burden of it's many failures in practice. - Olympus OM 1, Zuiko 35-70 f4, Fuji Superia 100 (Converted to B&W in Photoshop. The white streak running through the frame is the result of the film tearing and being exposed to light when removing it from the camera, and was more annoying in the original colour picture) - © Katrina Webster, Jan 2000

The lucky ones may have a houseboat or residence at Cat Ba or on the mainland (3 hours away at the speed these boats travel) but sometimes spend several days out fishing before returning home.

All along the banks of the Ngo Dong river lie the rice paddies, with walls of mud laboriously scooped from the river serving both to control the water and provide pathways to access the farms - Olympus OM1, Sigma 70-210 f3.5-4.5, Velvia - © Dylan Sutton, 2000

  caption: Our boat was only slow moving, laden down with the extra bulk of an elderly German tourist. While this alllowed me the extra time to take this shot, his inability to keep quiet and sit still was not an aid to handheld shooting with a slow 210mm lens and 50 ASA film. - Olympus OM1, Sigma 70-210 f3.5-4.5, Velvia - © Dylan Sutton, 2000

  title: Tam Coc Boat
  caption: I took this picture just as we were entering the last of the caves on the way home. The boats are made from woven reeds, sealed with mud. With our extra ballast we were only just afloat, and I was kindly handed a bailing bucket as I got onboard. When our German tourist pointed out to the oarswomen that there was moss growing on the boat, and helpfully pulled it off, we all shouted at him, and my picture taking had to almost stop so that I could bail full time. They managed to almost plug the hole, and we made it safely back to shore. - Olympus OM1, Tamron 24mm f2.5, Velvia - © Dylan Sutton, 2000

In the jar are at least 6 snakes, a few lizards, frogs, and a bird or two.Thankfully we didn't have to drink any, though the wine with bears gall bladder wasn't too awful, and the apricot  wine was very nice indeed. - Olympus OM 1, Zuiko 35-70 f4 @ ~60mm  f11, T20 flash, Fuji Superia 100 - © Dylan Sutton, Christmas day 1999

  caption: The friendly staff of the Diamond Hotel (Hang Bong St, Hoan Kiem district of Hanoi) put on a big christmas party for all the guests and staff. With the rapport that had built up over the month our group had been staying there (except me, who arrived just the day before), the party went off! Here Tim and Robyn strut their stuff - not since Fred Astaire has so much poncing been done with an umbrella (be thankful Man-Child isn't in the picture as well!). - Olympus OM 1, Samyang 28 f2.8 @ f16, T20 flash, Fuji Superia - © Dylan Sutton, Dec 1999
